# FCBot

FCBot is a Python tool for automated generation of fabrication and documentation files from FreeCAD projects easily, repeatably, and scriptably. It can be used with a companion Docker image containing FreeCAD for CI/CD workflows. FCBot is inspired by the wonderful KiCad tool [KiBot](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/KiBot).
